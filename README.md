## Multi-Table Extraction from PDF using Camelot in Streamlit


This Streamlit app allows you to upload a PDF file and extract multiple tables from it using the Camelot Python library. The app provides a user-friendly interface to display the extracted tables and offers a download option to save each table as an Excel file.

The app utilizes Camelot's read_pdf function with the stream flavor to extract tables from the uploaded PDF. It supports extracting tables from all pages of the PDF. The extracted tables are displayed in a tabular format in the Streamlit app, along with a table number for easy identification.

For each extracted table, the app provides a download button to save it as an Excel file. Each Excel file is named based on the table number, making it convenient to manage and organize the extracted tables.

With this app, you can efficiently extract multiple tables from a PDF and easily download them in Excel format for further analysis or use in other applications.
